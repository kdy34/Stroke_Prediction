# Stroke_Prediction
Creating a machine learning model for stroke prediction according to given datasets. This project contains cleaning the data, preprocessing the data, visualize the data, splitting the data and try to find out the most suitable model for this stroke prediction sections and also feauture engineering process. I combined two different dataset as a train dataset.
